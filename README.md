# Project 0 - TicTacToe

This is a simple _HTML/CSS/JS/JQUERY_ implementation of Tic Tac Toe.
It supports two player and single player against an AI.

Scores, players, and the current game state is saved to local storage.

The purpose of this project was solidify my understanding of manipulating the DOM via jquery and CSS.

## How to play

Go to: https://jinseal.github.io/GA-SEI34-Project0-TicTacToe/

1. Enter player one's name, symbol, and image.
1. Click join.
1. Either choose an AI from the drop dropdown, or configure a second human player.
1. Optionally change the size of the playing grid.
1. Once two players are present, click play.
1. Click on the grid to play.

Players can leave the game with the _leave_ button.

##  Bugs
- Local storage doesn't work with AI players, that's why the clear memory button is there.
- Players can join multiple times.
- There's plenty of scope of UX improvements.
